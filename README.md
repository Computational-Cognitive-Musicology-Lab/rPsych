# rPsych 

Use this package to generate browser-based interfaces for human-participant research.
The code you write in `rPsych` is compiled to [jsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org/v8/) (javascript) code, embedded directly in an html file.
jsPsych does *all* the real work, so thank Josh de Leeuw, Becky Gilbert, and BjÃ¶rn Luchterhandt, not me!
jsPsych includes detailed information about how to cite them, and their many contributors, [here](https://www.jspsych.org/v8/about/about/).

----

The purpose of `rPsych` is simply to allow R users to create jsPsych interfaces without having to code in Javascript.
However, the `rPsych` syntax for describing experiments is also significantly more concise than coding `jsPsych` directly.


## Project Status

This project has just barely begun, so little functionality is working yet, and there is no documentation.
